# AeroFleet third-pass task mining report

## Architecture and readiness

Aircraft readiness control adds a timeline-oriented operational workbench. It coordinates component life and maintenance windows, role-scoped authority, deterministic derived dispatchable hours, optimistic rollback, partial bulk recovery, route restoration, and before/after audit evidence. Task-readiness score: **96/100**. The 25 candidates include 18 medium-difficulty directions and 13 explicit multi-boundary directions.
