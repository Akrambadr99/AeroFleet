# Selected flight workflows

The /fleet/release-workspace workspace and its linked detail pages now edit the same persisted flight record. Use **Open record details** or **Open decision workflow** for the selected row. The `record` URL query identifies the editing target; **Back to workspace** restores that selection.

The selected flight retains its aircraft family and engineer capacity checks. New releases must match the selected flight ID and a configured schedule. An existing unscheduled flight can retain its evidence; a schedule is required for a new release.

## Persistence and recovery

- The collection is the source of truth for these connected screens.
- When no collection exists, the existing legacy ledger is imported as the primary record. The first successful save persists that collection; the original legacy key is retained as migration backup.
- Each editor retains its opening record snapshot. If that record changes or is archived elsewhere, a save fails visibly and preserves local input. **Reload record and discard local edits** opens the current version and restores keyboard focus to the record context.
- A change to another record is preserved when the selected edit is saved. A stale collection-wide action is rejected; **Refresh workspace** retains the selected ID.
- Missing and archived IDs never fall back silently to another record.
- Storage failures do not advance the editor snapshot, so an unchanged draft can be retried.
- Domain history remains in the ledger; successful detail writes append a collection audit entry.

New detail screens should use `openSelectedRecord` and `SelectedRecordRoute`. Direct writes through legacy ledger storage functions are retained for import compatibility and isolated tests; those keys are not synchronized after migration. The other operational-workspace aggregates remain separate domain models.

## Verification

`selectedRecord.test.ts` covers legacy migration, durable edits, unrelated-record preservation, stale snapshots, unavailable records, and storage failure. `e2e/fifteenth-pass.spec.ts` covers connected browser navigation and recovery. Run `npm run check` and `npm run test:e2e`.

The storage adapter detects stale snapshots before its write. It is a local browser persistence mechanism, not a transactional multi-user server or cross-tab locking service.
